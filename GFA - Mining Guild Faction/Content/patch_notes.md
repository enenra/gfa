[h1]Update 1.1[/h1]
[list]
[*]Added Scout encounter, which can scan an area to find player bases. If a base is discovered, and the Scout escapes, the area will be marked and attackers will spawn.
[*]Added Strike Fighter and Strike Squadron encounters, which will search areas that have been marked by Scouts and attack the player.
[*]Added Communications Relay (planetary) as well as special Communications Satellites (space) encounters which store the location coordinates if a Scout marks an area as containing a player base. Destroying them will clear the mark on the area.
[*]Added Cargo Drop encounter, consisting of one or multiple cargo containers, often defended.
[*]Added a Mining Guild Caltrop Mine as an option to spawn around space static encounters.
[*]Added Light and Heavy Defense Turret emplacements to defend static planetary Mining Guild encounters.
[*]Reduced chance to spawn the mostly intact landed versions of various ships.
[*]Adjusted all encounter loot down as it was too high in general.
[*]Fixed encounters not pulling from all dialogue variations.
