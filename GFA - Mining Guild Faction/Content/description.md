The Mining Guild is an organization operating in large parts of the galaxy, and a major collaborator of the Galactic Empire. In exchange for providing raw materials at heavily discounted prices, the Guild was able to avoid direct integration into the imperial apparatus - for now. In the meantime, the Guild makes full use of the more [i]relaxed[/i] view of the Empire on the topic of slavery, and has established itself as the law in many systems of the Outer Rim the Empire does not deem important enough to police directly.

[h1]Mining Guild Ships and Stations[/h1]
This mod contains many spaceships and stations that spawn on planets, moons and in space via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1521905890]Modular Encounters System (MES)[/url]. A full list of the encounters can be found in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3517125245]Encounter Guide[/url].

[h1]Advanced Mechanics and Interactions[/h1]
Encounters have extensive chat dialogues so that the player knows what is happening and why. They also have the ability to call for help, and nearby Mining Guild encounters have the ability to respond to these SOS signals, and, once it's resolved, return to their original tasks. Encounters can also react to the daytime and weather, by turning lights on / off or closing gates and doors, and they will spawn with different skins applied to certain blocks depending on the terrain they spawn on. These and more details are listed in the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3517125245]Encounter Guide[/url].

[h1]Mod Support: AiEnabled[/h1]
This mod includes support for spawning [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2596208372]AiEnabled[/url] bots as crew of some of these Mining Guild encounters. It is not required, but strongly recommended.

[*]More encounters and mechanics will be added to this mod in the future. This means that some existing encounters will potentially work differently after future updates, too.
[*]Spawn rates will need to be optimized but also strongly depend on what other MES encounter mods are installed - the more there are, the less of this mod will spawn.
[*]I will be making more MES encounter mods for other Star Wars factions in the future. Planned are: Imperial, Rebel, Civilian and potentially Pirate ones.

[b]Q: Can you make a version without WeaponCore?[/b]
No.

[b]Q: This is a lot of mods...[/b]
Yes, it is. And in order for the encounters to work and look as they do, these mods are needed. I will not be reducing the amount of mods. In fact, chances are that the amount of dependencies will increase as I add more encounters.

[b]Q: Will there be a mod.io version?[/b]
No. This mod requires various scripts to work, none of which work on consoles.
