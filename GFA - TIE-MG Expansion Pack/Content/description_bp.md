The TIE/mg Starfighter is identifieable by its cutout hexagonal solar collector panels and yellow paint. They offer better visibility and a sensor package able to identify ore deposits but sacrifice maneuvrability and combat performance. Exclusively in use by the Mining Guild, it can be found patrolling remote facilities and systems.
