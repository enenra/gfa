The TIE/mg Starfighter is identifieable by its cutout hexagonal solar collector panels and yellow paint. They offer better visibility and a sensor package able to identify ore deposits but sacrifice maneuvrability and combat performance. Exclusively in use by the Mining Guild, it can be found patrolling remote facilities and systems. This block kit contains all blocks necessary to build your very own TIE/mg Starfighter. The blocks have custom sounds, full build stages and LoDs. This is an expansion pack to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3238158579]TIE/ln Starfighter Block Kit[/url], as the Mining Guild TIE shares a lot of blocks with it. They assemble the probably most accurate [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3297099092]TIE/mg replica[/url] to date, with some adjustments to make them work better in Space Engineers.

[b]Q: Can you make a version without WeaponCore / Animation Engine?[/b]
No. Both mods are integral to the functionality.

[b]Q: Will there be a mod.io version?[/b]
No. This mod requires various scripts to work, none of which work on consoles.

[b]Q: Can you make X Star Wars mod?[/b]
The next GFA mod I'll be working on is a set of turrets. What comes after that is not set yet.

[b]Q: How dare you steal this mod from X!?[/b]
That's not really a question but let's address this anyway: I made all models in this mod by myself, from scratch. Other similar mods existing does not mean nobody else is allowed to make a mod like that anymore.
