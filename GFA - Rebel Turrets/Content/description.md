This mod adds a number of turrets from star wars to the game. They are currently mainly based on the turrets of the CR90 Corellian Corvette / Tantive IV but more will be added in the future. All turrets can accept both red and green gas cartridges as ammo, which changes the color of the bolts they shoot.

[*]I will be extending the pack in the future, depending on what turrets I need for various builds.
[*]An Imperial Turrets mod is also in the work, but still early on. In general, there isn't necessarily a clear delineation between which are rebel and which are imperial turrets. The division between the two mods is mostly arbitrary and depending on which faction used the turret in the movies & series.
[*]Balance is still heavily WIP and subject to change drastically.

[b]Q: Will there be a mod.io version?[/b]
No. This mod requires various scripts to work, none of which work on consoles.
