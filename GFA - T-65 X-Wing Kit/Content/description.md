The Incom T-65 X-wing starfighter was the primary all-purpose starfighter of the Rebel Alliance. Known for its versatility and exceptional combat performance, it was a favorite with Rebel pilots. This block kit contains all blocks necessary to build your very own X-Wing. Many blocks have custom animations and sounds, and all of them have full build stages and LoDs. I've spent a very long time working on these blocks and they assemble to probably the most accurate [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3044377039]X-Wing replica[/url] to date, with some adjustments to make them work better in Space Engineers.

[*]I have a couple more blocks planned for this mod which mainly will consist of standalone versions of the KX9 Laser Cannons, static S-Foils, as well as alternative versions of the Astromech Bay with different functionalities.
[*]Balance will be shaky until I get around to finishin my next mod project, the TIE Fighter, and have balanced the two ships against each other.

[b]Q: Can you make a version without WeaponCore / Animation Engine?[/b]
No. Both mods are integral to the functionality.

[b]Q: Will there be a mod.io version?[/b]
No. This mod requires various scripts to work, none of which work on consoles.

[b]Q: Can you make X Star Wars mod?[/b]
The next ship I'll be working on is the TIE Fighter. What comes after that is not set yet.

[b]Q: Can you fix the balance of these blocks?[/b]
Balance is gonna be somewhat iffy until I finish the TIE Fighter and balance them against each other, but feedback is generally welcome.

[b]Q: How dare you steal this mod from X!?[/b]
That's not really a question but let's address this anyway: I made all models in this mod by myself, from scratch. Other similar mods existing does not mean nobody else is allowed to make a mod like that anymore.
