[h1]Patch 1.1a[/h1]
[list]
[*]Rebalanced Hyperdrive power use. It will now require less, charge faster and be more efficient. However, the mass it can move was reduced. It's still enough for an X-Wing, even fully loaded, but this will hopefully discourage using it on non-X-Wing builds.
[*]Rebalanced Intakes. This is to be seen in context of my change of how repulsors work in general as the old method lead to much higher power consumption than intended. The new intake will now appear differently stat-wise but largely have the same actual effect when in use. 
A side effect of this change will, however, be that all X-Wing thrusters no longer have an abnormally strong ability to stop the craft down.
[*]I've moved a bunch of assets to a support mod called GFA - Shared Assets since they will be used in multiple GFA mods. This will save significant file size in the long run but of course means that mod is now also a dependency.
