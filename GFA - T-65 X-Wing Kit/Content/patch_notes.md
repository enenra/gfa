[h1]Patch 1.2[/h1]
[list]
[*]Added convergence for the Laser Cannons. They will now converge at roughly 350m out, but this also improves the ease of generally hitting things significantly, especially smaller targets.
[*]Increase shield damage significantly in line with TIE shield damage.
[*]Increased TIE main thruster thrust output to improve acceleration.
