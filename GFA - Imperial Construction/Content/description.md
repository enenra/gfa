This mod adds various blocks, both decorative and functional, to the game. The blocks are based off of designs used by the Empire in the Star Wars original trilogy and other media set in that timeframe.

[*]The Light Switch block can only be placed onto certain sides of certain blocks. Among them are the emissive sides of the decorative wall blocks as well as the hangar frame.
[*]If a Light Switch is placed onto a block, all directly connected blocks with emissives will have their colors adjusted to the light's color.
[*]The interior wall and hangar floor blocks are very glossy & shiny with the default skin / no skin. Using any other skin will have them look more normal.
[*]I will be making more blocks for this mod - it's not finished yet. But I'll likely make these as I need them for my Star Wars encounter mod.
