The standard starfighter of the Imperial Navy, the TIE (Twin Ion Engine) was known for its fast acceleration, poweful weapons systems and advantage in maneuvrability over its rebel X-Wing counterpart. Even though the TIE/ln lacked shields, skillful imperial pilots could utilize its agility to outmaneuver their opponents and avoid enemy fire. Generally deployed in large number, this craft performed a wide variety of roles for the imperial regime.
