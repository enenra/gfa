[h1]Patch 1.0d[/h1]
[list]
[*]Added MES / RivalAI versions of the repulsors for NPC encounters. As these are not limited by the script, server admins should ensure they are not used by players. They are by default inaccessible and MES will replace them with normal variants when the player takes over.
