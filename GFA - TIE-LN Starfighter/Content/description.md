The standard starfighter of the Imperial Navy, the TIE (Twin Ion Engine) was known for its fast acceleration, poweful weapons systems and advantage in maneuvrability over its rebel X-Wing counterpart. This block kit contains all blocks necessary to build your very own TIE/ln Starfighter. The blocks have custom sounds and some have animations. All of them have full build stages and LoDs. I've spent quite some time working on these blocks and they assemble to probably the most accurate [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3238166978]TIE/ln replica[/url] to date, with some adjustments to make them work better in Space Engineers.

[*]I have a couple more blocks planned for this mod. They will mainly consist of standalone versions of blocks that are easier to use in non-standard builds, as well as options for landing / docking the TIEs.
[*]I also plan to make several "expansion packs" for this block kit mod with the necessary blocks to build other TIE variants. The two I'll do for sure are for the Mining Guild TIE and the Interceptor.
[*]Balance will be shaky until I get enough feedback on its matchup against the X-Wing, at which point I'll be adjusting the balance of both.

[b]Q: Can you make a version without WeaponCore / Animation Engine?[/b]
No. Both mods are integral to the functionality.

[b]Q: Will there be a mod.io version?[/b]
No. This mod requires various scripts to work, none of which work on consoles.

[b]Q: Can you make X Star Wars mod?[/b]
The next GFA mod I'll be working on is a set of turrets. What comes after that is not set yet.

[b]Q: Will you make more TIE variants?[/b]
Yes! I'm planning on doing the interceptor and mining guild variants first of all, since those are similar enough to the base TIE to share most blocks. They will be released as expansion packs to this mod.

[b]Q: Can you fix the balance of these blocks?[/b]
Balance is gonna be somewhat iffy until I finish collecting feedback and information on its matchup against the X-Wing, but feedback is generally welcome.

[b]Q: How dare you steal this mod from X!?[/b]
That's not really a question but let's address this anyway: I made all models in this mod by myself, from scratch. Other similar mods existing does not mean nobody else is allowed to make a mod like that anymore.
