The repulsorlift engine is an anti-gravity technology created from subnuclear "knots" of space-time made by enormous unmanned power refineries encompassing black holes. Repulsorlift engines have great power but can only accelerate up to a speed of 25m/s. They work better in gravity than in space and are ideal for building Star Wars-type ships, which generally only have forward thrusters.

Repulsorlift Engines are thrusters with no thruster flame, and no damage area. They are intended to be used as secondary thrusters, as they are very strong, but cannot contribute to acceleration when the grid goes above 25m/s into the thrust direction. This means that it is always the most effective to face the direction of travel, which should contain the normal thrusters, and as such forces a flight behaviour more similar to WW2 planes / how Star Wars ships move, than how spaceships in Space Engineers normally do.

[*]The stats on these thrusters are likely going to change at some point in the future as I'm dialing in balance with various Star Wars mods and builds.
