The repulsorlift engine is an anti-gravity technology created from subnuclear "knots" of space-time made by enormous unmanned power refineries encompassing black holes. Hover-versions of repulsorlift engines are commonly used in landspeeders and do not work at high altitudes.
This mod is a patch for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1225107070]Takeshi's Hover Engine Mod[/url]. It does not contain any of his assets, and requires the original mod to be placed below this one in the mod list to work. This mod removes all but one type of hover engine and re-themes it for a Star Wars scenario.

Hover Repulsorlift Engines enable your ship to hover over planetary bodies. They come in a 1x1x1 and a 3x3x3 version for both large and small grid.

[*][b]Takeshi[/b] - It's completely based on his mod and without it wouldn't be possible.
[*][b]Digi[/b] - For his excellent script examples, one of which I'm using to disable the original BlockCategory.
