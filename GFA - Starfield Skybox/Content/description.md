This mod changes the look of the skybox to mimic the Star Wars movies - in particular A New Hope. The background consists of a plain but high resolution starfield. The sun has been decreased in size and had its colors altered to more closely resemble the movies as well. Other than that, this skybox mod does not alter many parameters and should therefore be highly compatible with your favourite mods that adjust lighting and post-processing.
