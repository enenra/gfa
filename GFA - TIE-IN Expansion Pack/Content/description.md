The TIE/in Starfighter is identifiable by its arrow-shaped solar collection panels, a distinct difference from the hexagonal solar arrays of its predecessor, the TIE/ln Fighter. The Interceptor is one of the fastest starfighters in the galaxy, nearly rivaling the Rebel RZ-1 A-Wing. This block kit contains all blocks necessary to build your very own TIE/in Starfighter. The blocks have custom sounds, full build stages and LoDs. This is an expansion pack to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3238158579]TIE/ln Starfighter Block Kit[/url], as the interceptor shares a lot of blocks with it. They assemble the probably most accurate [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3252738171]TIE/in replica[/url] to date, with some adjustments to make them work better in Space Engineers.

[b]Q: Can you make a version without WeaponCore / Animation Engine?[/b]
No. Both mods are integral to the functionality.

[b]Q: Will there be a mod.io version?[/b]
No. This mod requires various scripts to work, none of which work on consoles.

[b]Q: Can you make X Star Wars mod?[/b]
The next GFA mod I'll be working on is a set of turrets. What comes after that is not set yet.

[b]Q: How dare you steal this mod from X!?[/b]
That's not really a question but let's address this anyway: I made all models in this mod by myself, from scratch. Other similar mods existing does not mean nobody else is allowed to make a mod like that anymore.
